  Data Structures and Algorithms class focuses on teaching Data structures, how to use them, finding time complexity of algorithms, sorting, searching and tree traversal algorithms.

  In the group project, we were asked to use all of the data structures we learned during the class and at least one of both searching, sorting and traversal algorithms in the project.

  Homeworks and project are developed using IDEA Intellij in linux on Java 8
