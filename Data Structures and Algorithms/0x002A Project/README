0x002A is a game engine that focuses on creating text based games. It allows you to Create questions with multiple choices and add side effects to questions or answers to make the story as complex as you want. Also allows you to save your stories and play the story. Side effects can be something like when you're running from a zombie, if you don't have enough stamina, zombie may eventually catch up to you and kill you. Stamina is being the side effect here and allows you to have a different path. And your stamina can change depending on your earlier choices aswell.
